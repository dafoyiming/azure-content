# Azure Functions triggers and bindings developer reference


This topic provides general reference for triggers and bindings. It includes some of the advanced binding features and syntax supported by all binding types.  

If you are looking for detailed information around configuring and coding a specific type of trigger or binding, you may want to click on one of the trigger or bindings listed below instead:

[AZURE.INCLUDE [functions-selector-bindings](../../includes/functions-selector-bindings.md)] 

These articles assume that you've read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md), and the [C#](functions-reference-csharp.md), [F#](functions-reference-fsharp.md), or [Node.js](functions-reference-node.md) developer reference articles.



## Overview

Triggers are event responses used to trigger your custom code. They allow you to respond to events across the Azure platform or on premise. Bindings represent the necessary meta data used to connect your code to the desired trigger or associated input or output data.

To get a better idea of the different bindings you can integrate with your Azure Function app, refer to the following table.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [dynamic compute](../../includes/functions-bindings.md)]  

To better understand triggers and bindings in general, suppose you want to execute some code to process a new item dropped into an Azure Storage queue. Azure Functions provides an Azure Queue trigger to support this. You would need, the following information to monitor the queue:
 
- The storage account where the queue exists.
- The queue name.
- A variable name that your code would use to refer to the new item that was dropped into the queue.  
 
A queue trigger binding contains this information for an Azure function. The *function.json* file for each function contains all related bindings.  Here is an example *function.json* containing a queue trigger binding. 

	{
	  "bindings": [
	    {
	      "name": "myNewUserQueueItem",
	      "type": "queueTrigger",
	      "direction": "in",
	      "queueName": "queue-newusers",
	      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
	    }
	  ],
	  "disabled": false
	}

Your code may send different types of output depending on how the new queue item is processed. For example, you might want to write a new record to an Azure Storage table.  To accomplish this, you can setup an output binding to an Azure Storage table. Here is an example *function.json* that includes a storage table output binding that could be used with a queue trigger. 


	{
	  "bindings": [
	    {
	      "name": "myNewUserQueueItem",
	      "type": "queueTrigger",
	      "direction": "in",
	      "queueName": "queue-newusers",
	      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
	    },
	    {
	      "type": "table",
	      "name": "myNewUserTableBinding",
	      "tableName": "newUserTable",
	      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING",
	      "direction": "out"
	    }
	  ],
	  "disabled": false
	}


The following C# function responds to a new item being dropped into the queue and writes a new user entry into an Azure Storage table.

	#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

	using System;
	using Newtonsoft.Json;

	public static async Task Run(string myNewUserQueueItem, IAsyncCollector<Person> myNewUserTableBinding, 
									TraceWriter log)
	{
	    // In this example the queue item is a JSON string representing an order that contains the name, 
		// address and mobile number of the new customer.
	    dynamic order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(myNewUserQueueItem);
	
	    await myNewUserTableBinding.AddAsync(
	        new Person() { 
	            PartitionKey = "Test", 
	            RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), 
	            Name = order.name,
	            Address = order.address,
	            MobileNumber = order.mobileNumber }
	        );
	}
	
	public class Person
	{
	    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
	    public string RowKey { get; set; }
	    public string Name { get; set; }
	    public string Address { get; set; }
	    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
	}

For more code examples and more specific information regarding Azure storage types that are supported, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings for Azure Storage](functions-bindings-storage.md).


To use the more advanced binding features in the Azure portal, click the **Advanced editor** option on the **Integrate** tab of your function. The advanced editor allows you to edit the *function.json* directly in the portal.

## Dynamic parameter binding 

Instead of a static configuration setting for your output binding properties, you can configure the settings to be dynamically bound to data that is part of your trigger's input binding. Consider a scenario where new orders are processed using an Azure Storage queue. Each new queue item is a JSON string containing at least the following properties:

	{
	  name : "Customer Name",
	  address : "Customer's Address".
	  mobileNumber : "Customer's mobile number."
	}

You might want to send the customer an SMS text message using your Twilio account as an update that the order was received.  You can configure the `body` and `to` field of your Twilio output binding to be dynamically bound to the `name` and `mobileNumber` that were part of the input as follows.

    {
      "name": "myNewOrderItem",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "queueName": "queue-newOrders",
      "connection": "orders_STORAGE"
    },
    {
      "type": "twilioSms",
      "name": "message",
      "accountSid": "TwilioAccountSid",
      "authToken": "TwilioAuthToken",
      "to": "{mobileNumber}",
      "from": "+XXXYYYZZZZ",
      "body": "Thank you {name}, your order was received",
      "direction": "out"
    },
 
Now your function code only has to initialize the output parameter as follows. During execution the output properties will be bound to the desired input data.

C#

    // Even if you want to use a hard coded message and number in the binding, you must at least 
    // initialize the message variable.
    message = new SMSMessage();

    // When using dynamic parameter binding no need to set this in code.
	// message.body = msg;
	// message.to = myNewOrderItem.mobileNumber

Node.js

    context.bindings.message = {
        // When using dynamic parameter binding no need to set this in code.
        //body : msg,
        //to : myNewOrderItem.mobileNumber
    };




## Random GUIDs

Azure Functions provides a syntax to generate random GUIDs with your bindings. The following binding syntax will write output to a new BLOB with a unique name in an Azure Storage container: 

	{
	  "type": "blob",
	  "name": "blobOutput",
	  "direction": "out",
	  "path": "my-output-container/{rand-guid}"
	}



## Returning a single output

In cases where your function code returns a single output, you can use an output binding named `$return` to retain a more natural function signature in your code. This can only be used with languages that support a return value (C#, Node.js, F#). The binding would be similar to the following blob output binding that is used with a queue trigger.

	{
	  "bindings": [
	    {
	      "type": "queueTrigger",
	      "name": "input",
	      "direction": "in",
	      "queueName": "test-input-node"
	    },
	    {
	      "type": "blob",
	      "name": "$return",
	      "direction": "out",
	      "path": "test-output-node/{id}"
	    }
	  ]
	}


The following C# code returns the output more naturally without using an `out` parameter in the function signature.


	public static string Run(WorkItem input, TraceWriter log)
	{
	    string json = string.Format("{{ \"id\": \"{0}\" }}", input.Id);
	    log.Info($"C# script processed queue message. Item={json}");
	    return json;
	}

	// Async example
	public static Task<string> Run(WorkItem input, TraceWriter log)
	{
	    string json = string.Format("{{ \"id\": \"{0}\" }}", input.Id);
	    log.Info($"C# script processed queue message. Item={json}");
	    return json;
	}


This same approach is demonstrated below with Node.js.

	module.exports = function (context, input) {
	    var json = JSON.stringify(input);
	    context.log('Node.js script processed queue message', json);
	    context.done(null, json);
	}

F# example provided below.

	let Run(input: WorkItem, log: TraceWriter) =
	    let json = String.Format("{{ \"id\": \"{0}\" }}", input.Id)   
	    log.Info(sprintf "F# script processed queue message '%s'" json)
	    json

This can also be used with multiple output parameters by designating a single output with `$return`.


## Route support

By default when you create a function for an HTTP trigger, or WebHook, the function is addressable with a route of the form:

	http://<yourapp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<funcname> 

You can customize this route using the optional `route` property on the HTTP trigger's input binding. As an example, the following *function.json* file defines a `route` property for an HTTP trigger:

	{
	  "bindings": [
	    {
	      "type": "httpTrigger",
	      "name": "req",
	      "direction": "in",
	      "methods": [ "get" ],
	      "route": "products/{category:alpha}/{id:int?}"
	    },
	    {
	      "type": "http",
	      "name": "res",
	      "direction": "out"
	    }
	  ]
	}

Using this configuration, the function is now addressable with the following route instead of the original route.

	http://<yourapp>.azurewebsites.net/api/products/electronics/357

This allows the function code to support two parameters in the address, `category` and `id`. You can use any [Web API Route Constraint](https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2#constraints) with your parameters. The following C# function code makes use of both parameters.

	public static Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage request, string category, int? id, 
													TraceWriter log)
	{
	    if (id == null)
	       return  req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, $"All {category} items were requested.");
	    else
	       return  req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, $"{category} item with id = {id} has been requested.");
	}

Here is Node.js function code to use the same route parameters.

	module.exports = function (context, req) {

	    var category = context.bindingData.category;
	    var id = context.bindingData.id;
	
	    if (!id) {
	        context.res = {
	            // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
	            body: "All " + category + " items were requested."
	        };
	    }
	    else {
	        context.res = {
	            // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
	            body: category + " item with id = " + id + " was requested."
	        };
	    }
	
	    context.done();
	} 

By default, all function routes are prefixed with *api*. You can also customize or remove the prefix using the `http.routePrefix` property in your *host.json* file. The following example removes the *api* route prefix by using an empty string for the prefix in the *host.json* file.

	{
	  "http": {
	    "routePrefix": ""
	  }
    }

For detailed information on how to update the *host.json* file for your function, See, [How to update function app files](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). 

By adding this configuration, the function is now addressable with the following route:

	http://<yourapp>.azurewebsites.net/products/electronics/357

For information on other properties you can configure in your *host.json* file, see [host.json reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/host.json).
